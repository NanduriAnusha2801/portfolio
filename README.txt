Notes:
 - The contact form currently points to a placeholder Formspree URL. To receive messages:
    1) Sign up at https://formspree.io and create a form to get an endpoint like:
       https://formspree.io/f/abcdxyz
    2) Replace the form action in index.html with your endpoint.
    Alternatively replace the form action with "mailto:srianushananduri2801@gmail.com" as a quick fallback.

 - To preview locally: open index.html in your browser.
 - To deploy: push the folder to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or drag the folder into Netlify.

Customization I can do next:
 - Swap colors or fonts to match your personal brand.
 - Add project thumbnails, GitHub links, and live-demo links.
 - Integrate EmailJS or Netlify Forms for a serverless form that needs no third-party signup.
